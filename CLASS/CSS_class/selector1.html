     This is given less priority than id and class selector.
     last selector has highest priority.
     Universal selector is given list priority i.e it is considered to be
     defined first irrespective to the order of declaratioon

    Universal selector is need not to be declared in the .html, directly in css write(*{attributer}), 
    it can be mixed with elements like *p, *i, *b etc-->

    <!-- We prefer ID selector in java script, we can aslo use it in CSS.
         BUT we prefer class only in CSS, not in JS -->
